# NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine

## 🚀 Project Overview

An immersive 3D interactive web application that transforms NASA's 608+ space biology research publications into an explorable universe. Users navigate through space as research papers appear as glowing stars, connected by citation relationships, creating an intuitive way to discover groundbreaking research that shapes our journey to Mars and beyond.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌌 3D Universe Visualization
- **Papers as Stars**: Each publication appears as a glowing orb with size reflecting impact
- **Citation Networks**: Glowing lines connect related papers
- **Research Clusters**: Papers group into constellation-like formations by topic
- **Temporal Animation**: Watch 30 years of research evolve through time

### 🎮 Interactive Experience
- **Click Papers**: Detailed information panels with abstracts, authors, and metrics
- **Universe Navigation**: Smooth 3D camera controls with auto-orbit
- **Search Interface**: AI-powered semantic search with live suggestions
- **Timeline Control**: Scrub through decades of research history
